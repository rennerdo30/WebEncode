# WebEncode

WebEncode is a distributed video encoding tool designed to efficiently handle the encoding process through a central controller and multiple worker nodes. The tool utilizes Amazon S3 for shared file exchange between the applications, ensuring seamless communication and data transfer.

## Features

- **Distributed Encoding:** WebEncode is built to distribute the video encoding workload among multiple worker nodes, optimizing resource utilization and speeding up the overall encoding process.

- **Central Controller:** The central controller manages the encoding tasks, coordinating the communication between the web interface, file storage on S3, and the worker nodes. This centralized approach simplifies the coordination of encoding jobs.

- **Amazon S3 Integration:** WebEncode leverages Amazon S3 for shared file exchange, providing a reliable and scalable solution for storing and retrieving video files during the encoding process.

- **Web User Interface (WebUI):** The tool includes a user-friendly web interface for easy file upload and encoding queue management. The WebUI streamlines the process of initiating encoding tasks and monitoring the progress of ongoing jobs.

## Work in Progress

WebEncode is an ongoing project, and as of now, it is in the early stages of development. While the project lacks full functionality at the moment, the team is actively working on implementing features and improving the tool's capabilities.

## Getting Started

To get started with WebEncode, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies.
3. Configure the central controller and worker nodes.
4. Launch the WebUI to start managing your encoding tasks.

Detailed instructions for setting up and configuring WebEncode will be provided in the documentation (once available).
